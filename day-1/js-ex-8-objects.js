/*
    JavaScript Objects
    1) Create an object with four different properties, with values of your own choice (ex: name, birthday, hobby, email).
    Use a for-in loop (as sketched below) to demonstrate that we can iterate over the properties in an object.
    for(prop in myObj){
    console.log(prop,myObj[prop])
    }
    Use the delete keyword to demonstrate we can delete existing properties from an object (delete a property, and iterate over the properties again) 
    Add a new property to your object to demonstrate that we can add new properties to existing objects
