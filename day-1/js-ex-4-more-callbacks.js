/*
    More Callbacks 
    Take another look at the function expression declared in cb, and the provided callbacks in 5+6. What we have in cb is a very generic function that can take any callback that can do something with two numbers and return a value.

    4)  Write a mul(n1, n2) function (inspired by add and sub) and use it as the callback for the cb function
    5) Call cb, this time with an anonymous function that divides the first argument with the second
