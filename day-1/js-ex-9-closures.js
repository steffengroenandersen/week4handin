/*
    Closures in JavaScript 
    1) Implement and test the Closure Counter Example from the Slides
    2) Implement a reusable function using the Module pattern that should encapsulate information about a person (name, and age) and return an object with the following methods:
        setAge
        setName
        getInfo (should return a string like Peter, 45)
